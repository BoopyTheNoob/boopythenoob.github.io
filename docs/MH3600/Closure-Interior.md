# Closed Sets and Limit Points

## Closure and Interior of a Set

{: .highlight }
> **Lemma.** Let $$A$$ be a subset of a topological space $$X$$. Then:
> * $$A$$ is open if and only if $$A=\mathrm{Int}(A)$$;
> * $$A$$ is closed if and only if $$A=\overline{A}$$.

{: .highlight }
> **Theorem 17.5.** Let $$A$$ be a subset of the topological space $$X$$.
> 
> (a) Then $$x\in\overline{A}$$ if and only if every open set $$U$$ containing $$x$$ intersects $$A$$.
> 
> (b) Supposing the topology of $$X$$ is given by a basis, then $$x\in\overline{A}$$ if and only if every basis element $$B$$ containing $$x$$ intersects $$A$$.

## Hausdorff Spaces

{: .new }
> A topological space $$X$$ is called a **Hausdorff space** if for each pair $$x_1$$, $$x_2$$ of distinct points of $$X$$, there exist neighborhoods $$U_1$$ and $$U_2$$ of $$x_1$$ and $$x_2$$, respectively, that are disjoint.
