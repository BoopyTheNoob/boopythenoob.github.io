# Closure and Interior of a Set

{: .highlight}
**Theorem 17.5.** Let $$A$$ be a subset of the topological space $$X$$.

(a) Then $$x\in\overline{A}$$ if and only if every open set $$U$$ containing $$x$$ intersects $$A$$.

(b) Supposing the topology of $$X$$ is given by a basis, then $$x\in\overline{A}$$ if and only if every basis element $$B$$ containing $$x$$ intersects $$A$$.
