## Functions of Several Variables

{: .highlight}
Does the limit
$$\displaystyle\lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}\dfrac{x^2\sin(xy^2)}{x^4+9y^4}$$
exists? If it does, what is the limit? Justify your answer.

**Solution.** We first acknowledge these two results:

* $$\sin(x)\le x$$
for positive values of $$x$$.
* $$\dfrac{xy}{x^2+y^2}\le\dfrac{1}{2},$$
equality holds when $$x=y$$.

Okay.
