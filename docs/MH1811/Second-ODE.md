# Second Order Differential Equations

{: .highlight}
Find the general solution of the following ordinary differential equation:
$$y''-16y=4x\cos x.$$

**Solution.** The associated homogeneous equation and its characteristic equation are
$$y''-16y=0,\,\lambda^2-16=0.$$

The characteristic equation has roots of
$$\lambda=4$$
and
$$\lambda=-4,$$
therefore the homogeneous equation's solution (with $$C_1$$ and $$C_2$$ are arbitrary constants) is

$$y_h(x)=C_1e^{4x}+C_2e^{-4x}.$$
